Local_Impact
Challenge to know when to plant native seeds
Slower establishment of plantings
Wildlife populations impacted - require snow to protect eggs
Shift in species compositions - dry vs wet adapted species
"Phenological mismatch (earlier flowering, ect)"
Nutrient runoff (loss of dissolved N)
Flooding - minor/standing water
Flooding - extensive
Loss of burn window in fall 
Loss of burn window in the spring
Cool season grasses favored
Migration of species out of the area
Immigration of species into the area
Increase in invasive species
Increase in runoff
"Effects on plant growth, germination, seeds production, etc. "
Permanently shift to a wetter habitat
More intense fires (prescribed burns)
More wildfires
Increase in soil temperatures
Variability in soil temperatures
Drier vegetation shift
Threatened and endangered species vulnerable to extreme temps 
Thermal ranges in some plants and animals require cooler nighttime temps.
Warm season grasses (C4) prefer high air temps 
Seed stratification - seeds require cold temps to germinate properly
Pollutants/road salts washed in from roads
Whip lash shock - false spring followed by a freeze
"Distance for seed sourcing - changing what is considered ""native""?"
Timing of resources (federal hotshots) out of sync with burn window needs
Delayed frost - frozen ground needed large scale woody invasive removal
Plant communitiy shifts long term
Nighttime humidity promotes pathogens/disease in native plant communities
Variation in microhabitats or climate refugia available
